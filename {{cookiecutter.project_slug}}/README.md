## Binary Layout

Binary | Purpose
-------|----------
`api` | Main entry point for API. Building and running this binary with the relevant configuration will run the API

## Package Layout

Package | Purpose
--------|----------
`{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` | Main package to define structs (models) and interfaces to be implemented elsewhere. 
`env` | Environment configuration and setup
`handlers` | HTTP Handler functions to control access to API
`mock` | Mock implementations of service interfaces from `pkg/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}`
`postgresql` | DB implementations of service interfaces from `pkg/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}` backed by PostgreSQL

## Models

Some models and services are provided out-of-the-box as they are fairly commonplace in my API implementations.

Model | Purpose
------|---------
`AccountCredentials` | Holds account credentials performing password validation and verification
`AccountProfile` | Holds user preferences; profile information etc.
