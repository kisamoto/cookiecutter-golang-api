# {{cookiecutter.project_name}}

An opinionated template to create Go powered API's. Whilst this is primarily
for how _I_ create projects I am always looking for improvements and other 
options - Pull requests welcome. 

The aim here is to have the right balance between speed (both development
 and runtime), flexibility and modularity. 

## Usage

With [`cookiecutter`](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) installed, run:

```
$ cookiecutter gh:kisamoto/cookiecutter-golang-api
```

## More info

More information is found in the internal [`README`]({{cookiecutter.project_slug/README.md}})
